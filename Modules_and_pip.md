# Understanding Modules and Pip in Python

What are Modules?

Modules in Python are pieces of code that allow you to use code written by others in your Python programs.
They help to modularize and reuse code efficiently. Modules can be broadly classified into two types: built-in modules and external modules.

Built-in Modules

Built-in modules are shipped with the Python programming language. 
This means you don't need to install them separately; they come pre-installed with Python. 
These modules are always available in your Python environment and can be used directly by importing them.

Examples of built-in modules include:
- `math`: Provides mathematical functions.
- `sys`: Provides access to system-specific parameters and functions.
- `hashlib`: Provides secure hash and message digest algorithms.

### External Modules

External modules, also known as third-party modules, are not included with Python by default.
They are developed by the Python community and can be installed using a package manager. 
These modules need to be downloaded and installed from the internet before you can use them.

Examples of external modules include:
- `pandas`: A powerful data analysis and manipulation library.
- `scikit-learn` (imported as `sklearn`): A machine learning library.
- `tensorflow`: A library for machine learning and deep learning.

## Understanding Pip

Pip is the package installer for Python. It allows you to install and manage additional libraries and dependencies 
that are not part of the Python standard library. Pip makes it easy to download and install external modules from 
the Python Package Index (PyPI) and other repositories.

### Installing Pip

Pip is usually installed with Python. You can check if pip is installed by running the following command in your terminal:

pip --version


On macOS and Linux, you might need to use `pip3` for Python 3:
pip3 --version


Installing External Modules with Pip

To install an external module using pip, use the following syntax:
pip install module_name
For example, to install the `pandas` module, you would use:
pip install pandas

On macOS and Linux, you might need to use `pip3`:
pip3 install pandas

Using Installed Modules
Once you have installed a module using pip, you can import it into your Python program using the `import` statement. For example:
python
import pandas as pd
